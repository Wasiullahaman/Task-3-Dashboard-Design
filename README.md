# Task-3-Dashboard-Design

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard created as part of a Data Analyst Internship Task. The goal was to design an **interactive sales dashboard** that helps business stakeholders understand key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **Sales, Profit, and Growth**.

This dataset is commonly used for sales analysis and can be downloaded from Kaggle.
